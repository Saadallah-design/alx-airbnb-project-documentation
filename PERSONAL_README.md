# 🏡 This repository is my **learning playground** 
For understanding how real-world backend systems are designed **before coding begins**.  

I’m not writing production-level code here yet—this phase is about **planning, designing, and documenting** the system that could power an Airbnb-like app.  

The goal: learn how to move from a vague project idea → into **structured, professional documentation** that real software teams create at the start of a project.  

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives  

By working through this repo, I’m training myself to:  

1. **Break down requirements** → turn a project idea into a clear list of features & functionalities.  
2. **Visualize the system** → make diagrams (Use Case, DFDs, Flowcharts) that show how users and the backend interact.  
3. **Think like a user** → write **User Stories** that describe needs from the end-user perspective.  
4. **Map data movement** → learn how information flows through the system with **Data Flow Diagrams**.  
5. **Detail processes** → use Flowcharts to clarify logic and decision points.  
6. **Write technical specs** → practice writing clean API definitions, validation rules, and backend behavior docs.  
7. **Use industry tools** → practice with Draw.io (diagrams), Git/GitHub (version control), and Markdown (docs).  

## 🗝️ Key Concepts I’m Practicing  

- **Backend Architecture** → routers, controllers, models, services.  
- **RESTful API Design** → endpoints using `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` and correct status codes.  
- **Data Modeling** → designing a database schema for Users, Properties, Bookings, etc.  
- **Authentication & Authorization** → JWTs, bcrypt, and securing resources.  
- **Payment Integration** → thinking about how Stripe or PayPal could fit into the system.  
- **Documentation-first mindset** → making the kind of artifacts companies use before coding.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries I’m Exploring  

- **Diagrams** → [Draw.io / Diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/)  
- **Version Control** → Git & GitHub  
- **Docs** → Markdown for README & project notes  

**(Future backend stack candidates for implementation):**  
- Node.js + Express.js  
- PostgreSQL / MongoDB  
- bcrypt (password hashing)  
- jsonwebtoken (JWTs)  
- Stripe API (payments)  

## 🌍 Real-World Connection  

This repo is meant to **mirror the early phases of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):**  

- 📄 **Product Requirements Doc (PRD)** → feature list  
- 🎭 **System Design Diagrams** → Use Case Diagrams, DFDs  
- 📝 **Agile Backlog** → User Stories  
- ⚙️ **Technical Specs** → API endpoints & validation rules  

This is exactly how **Product Managers, System Analysts, and Engineers** collaborate before any code is written. Learning this process will make me more prepared for **real development projects**.  

## ✅ Current Status  

- [ ] Feature List drafted  
- [ ] Use Case Diagrams created  
- [ ] User Stories written  
- [ ] Data Flow Diagrams mapped  
- [ ] Flowcharts designed  
- [ ] API Specifications detailed  

*(I’ll check these off as I complete each step.)*  

## 📚 Notes for Future Me  

- Don’t just rush to code → the **design phase saves hours of debugging later**.  
- This repo is my **blueprint practice ground**. If I revisit in the future, I’ll remember this was about **learning how to think like a backend engineer before coding**.  
- Once I finish the docs, I can extend this repo into a **real backend project** (Node.js, Express, DB).  

👉 This README is my **guide and reflection tool**. Anytime I return, I’ll know what I was learning, why I did it this way, and where I left off.
