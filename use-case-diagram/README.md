# 🏡 Visualize system interactions using a use case diagram.

==> 🎯 This directory visualizes system interactions using case diagram. 
↳ The interaction outline here will be around key functionalities like user registration, property booking and payment. 

==>> The use case diagram created for this captures the interaction of user with search and filter; looking for the suitable property then goes to property details, desired booked duration then to payments methods. At payment interaction the API payment integration either accepts or declines the payment. If payment is accepted the user then gets a confirmation email with further details about his/her bookings.
